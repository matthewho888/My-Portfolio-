        <h2>Spam & Ham</h2>
        <p>I built a binary classifier that detects spam emails with 98% accuracy. This project combined exploratory data analysis, feature engineering (One-Hot Encoding), and Scikit-Learn to train a logistic regression model that classifies emails as spam or ham.</p>

        <h2>Fairness in Housing Appraisals</h2>

        <h2>Build Your Own World</h2>
        <p>For my first major Java project, I developed a 2D tile-based world generation and exploration game inspired by Berkeleyâ€™s CS61B final project. The game engine generates random explorable worlds, integrating complex data structures and algorithms.</p>
