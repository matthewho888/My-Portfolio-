        <h2>Professional Interests</h2>

        <h3>Tech</h3>
        <p>I’m fascinated by how technology is constantly evolving to achieve incredible things. The rapid advancements in AI, data science, and automation open up limitless possibilities, and I am interested in exploring how data science can shape the future.</p>

        <h3>Public Health</h3>
        <p>Public health gives me a broader perspective on both learning and life. It allows me to dive into a wide range of topics, from the immune system to policy and social determinants of health. I hear different opinions from all sorts of perspectives. I appreciate how interconnected everything is, and how public health plays a role in shaping communities and global well-being.</p>

        <h3>The Intersection of Tech & Health</h3>
        <p>My goal is to explore the intersection of technology and public health, particularly how data science can be used to tackle real-world health challenges. Growing up in South Africa, America, and Taiwan has given me insight into different healthcare systems, lifestyles, and access to resources. I hope to lead and experience firsthand how technology can bridge gaps in healthcare, improve accessibility, and drive positive change for those in need.</p>
